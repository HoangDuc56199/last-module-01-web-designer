            Good nutrition is a lifestyle, not a diet. It starts with a new way
            of thinking about food. Think of your body as a vehicle that uses
            food for fuel. Fill your tank with the right type of fuel. Do not
            approach your nutrition plan as a diet plan, but rather, a lifestyle
            change. If you make a permanent change, you will see big results.
            The key to success is a daily focus on your goal. Portion your meals
            and track your calories. There are many free mobile apps available
            to help track your activity level and calories. Control impulsive
            urges to buy junk food, and instead, allow yourself to one "cheat"
            meal a week. (edited)

            Use the following as a guideline: Protein, such as eggs, chicken,
            and lean red meat Vegetables, but avoid corn and peas Fruit Fat,
            such as olive oil, nuts, and seeds Limit the consumption of bread,
            pasta, white potatoes, and processed food. These foods are high in
            carbohydrates. When you shop for groceries, shop the outside aisles
            and buy organic when possible. Stock up on fresh vegetables, almond
            flour, and flax seed. Check out our Meal of the Week for new meal
            ideas.
